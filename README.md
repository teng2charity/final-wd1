This website is a showcase of photographs I took personally and my best work so far.
The design is pretty simple, everything is displayed and organized on a single webpage.
I wanted to use a kawaii aesthetic which is I why I chose the font I used.
The colors are mostly pastels with darker hues.
The most trouble I had was with displaying multiple images.
